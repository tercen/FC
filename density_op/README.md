# Density operator
This operator is useful to create visuals using density (i.e. smooth scatter plots), it is based on the ``smoothScatter`` plot in r.

## How to use
Requires as columns = variables (e.g. channels) and rows = observations (e.g. cell)


## TODO
* check input only has two cols
* improve the mapping between the input ids to output ids, currently it is totaly random.
